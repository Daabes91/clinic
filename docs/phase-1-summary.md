# Phase 1 â€” Monorepo Foundations (Completed)

## Deliverables
- pnpm workspace (`pnpm-workspace.yaml`) covering `apps/*` and `packages/*`.
- Next.js placeholders for public web (`apps/web`) and admin (`apps/admin`) with shared Tailwind configs, layouts, and environment templates.
- Spring Boot skeleton (`apps/api`) with Gradle build, entrypoint, and baseline configuration.
- Shared UI kit package (`packages/ui-kit`) with TypeScript build tooling in place.
- Repository-level tooling: ESLint, Prettier, base TypeScript config, and `.gitignore`.

## Outstanding Tasks For Phase 2
- Flesh out API module structure separating controllers/services for `/api/public/**` and `/api/admin/**`.
- Implement Spring Security configuration with JWT filters and RBAC guards.
- Introduce Flyway migration baseline and database schema placeholders.
- Define API DTO packages and mapper strategy.

See `docs/project-phases.md` for the broader roadmap.
